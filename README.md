# 🎮 SudokuArena – Frontend

**SudokuArena** is the front end of the Sudoku Solver & Player platform. It allows users to play, solve, and track Sudoku puzzles, view personal statistics, and compete via a global leaderboard. Built with **Next.js**, **Chakra UI**, and **React Hook Form**, it connects to the [SudokuSolver REST API](https://github.com/raphaellndr/SudokuAPI).

- Available controls during the game:
  - ⏸️ **Pause**: Stops the timer and hides the grid.
  - ✅ **Check Cell**: Verify if a selected cell is correct.
  - 💡 **Hint**: Reveal the correct number for a cell.
  - 🔄 **Restart**: Reset the current puzzle and timer.
  - 🚪 **Give Up / New Grid**: End the session and load a new game.

The page also includes:

### 🧪 Image-Based Sudoku Detection (Experimental)

A new feature is currently in development that allows users to **detect and autofill Sudoku grids from images**.

#### How It Works:

1. **No camera? No problem** – If the current device doesn’t have a back-facing camera (e.g., a desktop), a **QR code** is displayed.
2. **Scan with your phone** – The QR code opens a special capture page on your mobile device.
3. **Capture & Send** – Take a photo of the Sudoku puzzle on your phone. The image is sent to the backend.
4. **Grid Detection & Autofill** – The backend processes the image, detects the grid, and sends it back to the front end to populate the puzzle automatically in **Play** or **Solve** mode.

📌 The backend detection pipeline is already implemented. Frontend integration is in progress.

> ⚠️ This feature is experimental and may evolve based on testing and feedback.

### 🔄 Real-Time Feedback via WebSockets

**SudokuArena** uses WebSockets to provide real-time feedback for asynchronous operations, enhancing user experience with timely updates:

- 🧠 **Sudoku Solving**: Get notified when a puzzle sent for solving has completed or not.
- 🖼️ **Image-Based Grid Detection**: After uploading an image for grid detection, receive a real-time notification once the sudoku has been detected. The frontend then fetches and autofills the grid.

> WebSockets are used strictly for **status notifications**, not for real-time multiplayer or board interactions (yet).
